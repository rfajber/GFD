# GFD
This contains code from my work related to GFD 2017

There are 4 main components 
1) Thin Film Code
2) Uncoupled Vortex Filament 
3) Coupled Vortex Filament 
4) Hibler Rheology Coupled Vortex Filament 

All contain both numerical code as well as analysis code.

The current plan is to extend number 4 into a radial coordinate as well to do eddy simulations.
